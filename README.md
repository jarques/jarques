### Product Designer, builder of things & adventurer

Currently building Cykick, an AI-powered training & nutrition coach for cyclists. And recently launched Payload, a time tracking app for freelancers.

I am also designing and advising at Moonbeam to help creators grow thriving communities â€” plus two stealth AI startups.

Previously led design at AddGlow, helping brands lower CAC & increase LTV via communities. Led design & product at Paper (acquired by thirdweb) launching NFT Checkout & Wallets that powered over $10M in transactions for thousands of Web3 developers. Spent 8+ years at Twitch building and leading design teams across all verticals. Helped millions of academics connect and share research at Academia.edu.
