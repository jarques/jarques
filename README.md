### Product Designer, builder of things & adventurer

Husband. Photographer. Designer, builder, mentor. Design & Product at Paper. Previously AddGlow, Paper (now thirdweb), Twitch, Academia.edu I love working on complex design problems and building products that have real impact.

Wanderlust also struck me at a young age and I've been trying to experience as many cultures as I can with my wife since. My camera is always with me on my travels to do my best at documenting them.
